MOOOOOOOOOOOON is a small browser game created with Phaser.

In this game you are a rocket, that tries to steal moons from planets around you.

You steer the rocket with your mouse and can steal moons by getting close to them.

You loose the game, when you collide with a planet and win the game, when you manage to grab all the moons.
